        <p id="info">
            All products are hand-knitted and carefully crafted. Çanta began as a project
             that was primarily dedicated to creating hand-knitted bags. Within 6 months, 
             it expanded to include other hand-knitted garments such as dresses, turtlenecks, hats and shawls.
             <br> 
             <br> 
             Çanta directly draws inspiration from the streets, lifestyle, people and products from Shkodër, 
             Albania where the creator of Çanta originates from. Future products will be created through the use 
             of traditional knitting techniques. These future products will represent the customs and traditions 
             of the different communities in the surrounding areas of Shkodër.
             <br> 
             <br> 
             Currently, products are created in the city of Montreal, known as Tiohtiá:ke. Çanta acknowledges that 
             this unceded land has long been a site of meeting and exchange amongst diverse Indigenous peoples.
